# Cion/Kinan Account Manager

## Description

Basic JS script to move accounts around depending on status and report stats to a Discord webhook.

## Requirements

1. NodeJS 18+
2. MySQL

## Setup

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Fill out config `cp config/default.json config/local.json`
4. Run with `npm start`
5. (Optional) Run on a cron schedule with PM2 `pm2 start ./src/index.js --name accounts --cron "*/30 * * * *"`

## Config

### `discordWebhookUrl`

A Discord webhook address to send reports to.

### `levelToMove`

The level that at an account should reach in your leveling process before it's distributed to your production processes.

### `kinanOutputFolder`

The _relative_ path from the directory that you're executing this script. So if you're in the root of this project, and your output is in `../kinan/output`, you would put that here. If you leave this blank, it will instead determine the difference in level 0s made by comparing the total counts in the database since the last run.

### `levelerDb`

The database for your dedicated leveler instance. If you aren't using a dedicated leveler, you probably don't need this script. The `reloadUrl` key is if you want to call an API to refresh the accounts in memory, or something.

### `destinationDbs`

You can put any number of databases here that you wish to distribute accounts to. You must set the `ratio` for every database. So if you want to split them evenly between two destinations you would put `0.5` for each. If you want to send 1/3 of the accounts to one destination and 2/3 to another, you would put `0.333` and `0.666` respectively.
